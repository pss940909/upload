          Spending all this extra time at home really had been a cherry on top
          of a crazy, strange, eventless year. Us Sydner-siders have been stuck
          in lockdown for about 12 weeks now, but we are taking our hats off to
          our Melbourne friends, who have been through this way harder than us.
          Our thoughts are with you Melburnians!
        </p>

        <p class="news_para">
          To liven things up, we wanted to talk all things interior design &
          styling at home. With all the extra time you are spending at home,
          perhaps you are sick of your old couch, or your dining chairs have
          been through it all. You desperately need a re-style, not just for
          your space, but also for your mental well being.

        <p class="news_para">
          Remember that your home is supposed to be a place of relaxation,
          comfort, healing and reflection. It should not be a source of anxiety
          or stress. During the last 2 years, we have heard many of our clients
          and friends complaining about their home feeling quite dull,
          uninspiring and often quite depressing, leaving them feeling with low
          moods and an increase of mental health issues.

        <p class="news_para">
          Did you know you environments can affect your mental health? This is
          the same way colours can affect mood and evoke emotions, and even
          furniture placement and space layout (Feng Shui) can harmonize your
          environments.
        </p>

        <p class="news_para">
          This brings us to Neuroarchitecture, a study of the body and brain and
          how it all responds to the built environment (Ian Ritchie, 2020). It
          is broke down into 4 seperate principles:
        </p>

        <ul class="para_list">
          <li>Sensation & Perception</li>
          <li>Learning & Memory</li>
          <li>Decision Making</li>
          <li>New Experiences</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="news_para">
          This type of design style is most generally applied to commercial
          spaces, such as corporate workspaces, schools, clinics and hospitals.
          These principles used in Neuroarchitecture can also be applied to
          designs within your home, which can ultimately help create positive
          environments in unexpected ways. We need more designers applying these
          principles within the home. As we are spending so much time at home,
          realistically this is the time we need these principles the most.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          “What’s distinct about neuroarchitecture is that we’re now approaching
          a time when our understanding of brain function has progressed to the
          point where we can start to say sensible things about its relationship
          with architecture and design” -- Dr Colin Ellard, author and professor
          of cognitive neuroscience. (Houzz, 2018)

          The idea that design can help create positive environments and
          ultimately help boost mental health issues is very powerful. This is
          why we are so passionate about providing affordable interior design
          services to our clients as we believe everyone should have the chance
          to be able to create a uplifting home environment that will help
          create a positive, safe and happy space, not just for you and for the
          whole family.

          So can my home interior design actually help with my mental health?
          The answer is YES, YES, YES!
        </p>
        <p class="news_para">
          Yes, that's all very well, but what the hell do those principles mean
          and how do I apply them in my home with no design knowledge. This is
          where we come in to help and offer you our tips and tricks over the
          next few weeks to help you style your home and your mind using the 4
          Neuroarchitecture principles.

          Please stay tuned as we will be releasing a blog post every week,
          starting next week for the next 4 weeks (wow that's a bit of a tongue
          twister). We will be starting with Sensation & Perception and will be
          providing you simple tips and tricks to help you aim to achieve a
          positive environment within your home.
        </p>
        <p class="news_para">
          We are so excited to be doing this. If you have any questions please
          contact us with your specific design questions relating to this post
          and we will aim to answer your question in the next blog post.
